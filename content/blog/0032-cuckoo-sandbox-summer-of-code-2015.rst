| This summer the `Cuckoo Sandbox <http://cuckoosandbox.org/>`__ project
  is participating the `Google Summer of Code
  2015, <https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015>`__
  thanks to a big effort of the `Honeynet
  Project <http://www.honeynet.org/gsoc>`__.
| This is a great opportunity for students who would like to work on
  Cuckoo and get paid for it! This is a great challenge and an huge
  opportunity to work on a real malware sandbox, write code and gain
  valuable experience, and help improving the open source security tools
  ecosystem.
| Almost all college and graduate students are eligible, we are
  searching for problem solving people with strong development skills
  who would like to learn about malware and OS (Linux and Mac OS X)
  internals.

Cuckoo Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The proposed Cuckoo project are the following (taken from `Honeynet GSOC
ideas <https://honeynet.org/gsoc/ideas>`__):

-  **Project Name: Project 18 - Cuckoo Sandbox #1: Support for Linux
   binaries**
   Mentor: Alessandro Tanasi (IT)
   Backup mentor: TBD
   Skills required: Python, Linux internals, Django (optional)
   Project type: Extend and improve existing library
   Project goal: Improve Cuckoo Sandbox to support analysis of Linux
   malware.
   Description: We would like to expand Cuckoo to support execution of
   Linux malware. To develop this feature it is required to design and
   write a custom python analyzer (a little engine with modules), that
   will follow Cuckoo's existing win32 architecture to run the malware
   inside a Linux virtual machine, instrument and record the malware
   behavior then return the execution analysis information back to
   Cuckoo's existing reporting components.
-  **Project Name: Project 19 - Cuckoo Sandbox #2: Support for Mac OS
   binaries**
   Mentor: Alessandro Tanasi (IT)
   Backup mentor: TBD
   Skills required: Python, Mac OS X internals, Django (optional)
   Project type: Extend and improve existing library
   Project goal: Improve Cuckoo Sandbox to support analysis of Mac OS X
   malware.
   Description: We would like to expand Cuckoo to support execution of
   Mac OS X malware. To develop this feature it is required to design
   and write a custom python analyzer (a little engine with modules),
   that will follow Cuckoo's existing win32 architecture to run the
   malware inside a Mac OS X virtual machine, instrument and record the
   malware behavior then return the execution analysis information back
   to Cuckoo's existing reporting components.

Who is eligible?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to meet the following **requirements** to apply to a Cuckoo
GSOC Project:

-  You should be a college or graduate students.
-  You should not have a job.
-  Python knowledge is required.
-  Mac OS X or Linux internals knowledge is required.

Where to  start?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First of all I would recommend to read, read and read again all the
pages related to GSOC on Google GSOC website and Honeynet GSOC, it is
really mandatory to understand how a Google Summer of Code works, what
you are expected to do and what you can expect.

A fundamental link is the `GSOC
timeline <https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2015>`__
where all GSOC phases are explained with all the deadlines. For example
today we are in a phase where wannabe students talks with their mentors
to understand as much as they can about the technology and the project.

For example I would suggest to:

-  Install and start to play with Cuckoo.
-  Read the documentation and the code to understand how it works.
-  Check the `GitHub page <https://github.com/cuckoobox/cuckoo>`__ to
   understand how Cuckoo's development works.
-  Try to think about how to design the implementation of the project
   you choose and start to learn things.
-  If you need some clarifications get in touch with me or other
   Cuckoo's developer.

How to apply?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should apply on Google GSOC page, applications are only accepted
**from March 16 until March 27 at 19:00 UTC**, so pinpoint it on you
calendar.

Application should be submitted using the "Log in" button in the
"**Student**" area,  I suggest you to take your time to prepare your
application.

Get in touch
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is encouraged to talk with your project mentors, for example:

-  Join the \ `Honeynet GSOC mailing
   list <https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc>`__ and write
   an email to present yourself.
-  Join the Honeynet GSOC IRC channel \ **#gsoc-honeynet** on
   **irc.freenode.net** to about the GSOC project and understand how it
   works. You can also get in touch with Cuckoo's mentors here.
-  Join the Cuckoo IRC channel \ **#cuckoosandbox** IRC channel on
   **irc.freenode.net** to talk with Cuckoo's developers and talk about
   the project.
