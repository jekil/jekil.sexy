**TL;DR:** What happened today? Thanks to the worst customer service
provided by `Lufthansa <http://www.lufthansa.com/>`__ I am going to
explain you why I missed a day in Vegas and why, in my over 15 years
experience, you should stop flying Lufthansa.

Today, I was heading to Las Vegas, to chill out at
`BlackHat <https://www.blackhat.com/>`__ and
`Defcon <https://www.defcon.org/>`__, via Frankfurt and Philadelphia.
I was flying  Lufthansa, because in long flights I prefer to spend
more and be safe; with my 2 dogs in a checked-in box. Due to many
Lufthansa fails in logistics and customer service I miss my flight and
I have been *re-protected* on a flight tomorrow.

So I would dissect the problem, to understand how multiple faults
could face in missing a flight and have a reputational issue to
manage.

In my opinion Lufthansa fails could be categorized as follows:

-  **Manage your logistics**: if you want to check-in more or less 100
   people, with only one check-in line open, you are going to, not only
   take more time than expected, but taking ages.
-  **Get more personeel**: if the people at check-in desks are the same
   opening the gates, they can not start boarding until they finish
   checking in people. So one delay one one side leads to another bigger
   delay.
-  **Training**: please train people, for example at check-in desks they
   were totally unaware on the rules to check-in dogs. I had to tell
   them how much I was expected to pay and other details, just because I
   read the "How to check-in your dogs" rules before boarding.
-  **Manage crisis**: when we land in Frankfurt it was clear we were
   really late. All times I were late, the company I was flying with,
   was so kind to announce "Hey Mr. X you are late so we are going to
   help you, someone is waiting for you at end of the stairs". But with
   Lufthansa  no announcements, nobody cares if a flight is late.
-  **Customer service #1: keep your word**: Landed in Frankfurt, I asked
   at the first Lufthansa hostess at the terminal how to get my
   connected flight. She checked and said "Don't worry they will wait
   for you". Sadly but true: I arrived at the gate 10 minutes late and
   they don't wait.
-  **Customer service #2: manage exceptions**: when I approached the
   passport control the line was really long, so I asked a Lufthansa
   hostess if there is a priority line for us, she said "Just one line
   and no priority". So the incapacity to manage exceptions leads to
   re-protection (costs for Lufthansa).
-  **Customer service #3: don't be a liar**: I asked again to another
   Lufthansa hostess and I insisted, she checked and said "You will
   found someone waiting for you other the passport control". No one was
   waiting.
-  **Customer service #4: make clients happy**: I missed the flight and
   asked  for support to the service desk, I found an angry girl. When
   someone comes to you for a problem caused by you, you should
   apologize and reward him. Just saying "we are sorry, the next flight
   is tomorrow" in economy class because business is fully booked and
   you will stay in a shitty hotel with a free 20 euros dinner, when you
   are used to five stars hotel and to spend more than that just for
   beers looks like a joke.
-  **Cruelty to animals #1**: I asked to have my dogs back for the
   night, when I finally had my box back, it was all wet (it was raining
   so probably they left it under the rain). The pillow and blanket
   inside were wet: my dogs were sitting on the wet. Lufthansa publicize
   a lot how they threat pets, I am not sure this it what they meant.
-  **Cruelty to animals #2**: I found a food stamp on the dog's box, it
   means someone kicked it. I am not sure this is the proper way to deal
   with live animals.
-  **Missing authentication**: When I finally found my dog's box, it was
   left unattended on a corner in a baggage claim hall. No one is
   guarding it and no one asked me when I get them. So virtually anyone
   could steal your pets.

Citing Forrest Gump: "shit happens" but how you deal with shit, how you
manage crisis and customer service make the difference from losing
clients and transform an issue in a success story. And please, never be
a liar.
